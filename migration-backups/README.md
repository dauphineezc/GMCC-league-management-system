# Migration Backups

## What Happened

During the permission system migration, backup files were created for all modified pages.
These backups have been archived here for reference.

## Original Backup Files (Before Archive)

The following backup files were created during migration:

### Home Pages
- `src/app/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/player/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/(superadmin)/superadmin/page.tsx.backup`

### League Pages
- `src/app/leagues/[leagueId]/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/leagues/[leagueId]/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/(superadmin)/superadmin/leagues/[leagueId]/page.tsx.backup`

### Team Pages
- `src/app/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/(superadmin)/superadmin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup`

### Schedule & Results Pages
- `src/app/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule/page.tsx.backup`
- `src/app/leagues/[leagueId]/results/page.tsx.backup`

## Current State

All migrations have been successfully completed and tested. The working codebase is functioning correctly.

These backups can be deleted once you're confident the migration is stable (recommended after 1-2 weeks in production).

## Rollback

If you ever need to rollback, you can:
1. Use git history to restore old files
2. Refer to the detailed migration documentation in `/docs`

The migration is fully documented with before/after examples in the docs folder.
