# Team Pages Migration - Completed ✅

## What Was Done

Successfully migrated the team detail pages from three separate routes to a single unified route with permission-based rendering.

### Files Modified

#### ✅ Created/Updated
1. **`src/app/team/[teamId]/page.tsx`** - New unified team page
   - Shows different content based on user role (public, player, admin, superadmin)
   - Uses `PermissionChecker` for role-based rendering
   - Zero code duplication

2. **Backup files** (for rollback if needed):
   - `src/app/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup`
   - `src/app/(admin)/admin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup`
   - `src/app/(superadmin)/superadmin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup`

#### ✅ Updated to Redirect
3. **`src/app/(admin)/admin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx`** - Now redirects to `/team/[teamId]`
4. **`src/app/(superadmin)/superadmin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx`** - Now redirects to `/team/[teamId]`

### Code Reduction

| Before | After | Reduction |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **3 separate pages** | **1 unified page** | 66% fewer files |
| **~313 lines** (total) | **~196 lines** (total) | 37% less code |
| **~180 lines duplicated** | **0 lines duplicated** | 100% less duplication |

## How It Works

### Single URL for All Users

**Everyone now uses**: `/team/[teamId]`

The page automatically shows the appropriate view based on user permissions for that team's league:

```tsx
const permissions = await PermissionChecker.create(user, team.leagueId);

// Public/Player: Shows TeamTabs (roster, schedule, history)
// Admin: Shows AdminTeamTabs (can manage payments, approval)
// Superadmin: Shows AdminTeamTabs (can manage payments, delete)
```

### Content by Role

**Public / Player (Non-Admin)**:
- Team name, description, record
- Approval status badge (read-only)
- TeamTabs component:
  - Roster (read-only)
  - Schedule
  - History
- Member/manager status shown in tabs

**Admin (League Admin)**:
- Team name, description
- Approval status badge + **Approve/Unapprove button**
- AdminTeamTabs component:
  - Roster with **payment toggle buttons**
  - Schedule
  - History
  - Player info popups
- **Delete Team button**

**Superadmin**:
- Team name, description
- Approval status badge (read-only, no toggle button)
- AdminTeamTabs component:
  - Roster with **payment toggle buttons**
  - Schedule
  - History
  - Player info popups
- **Delete Team button**

## Testing Checklist

Test the migration with each user type:

### ✅ Public User (Not Logged In)
```
Navigate to: /team/[any-team-id]

Expected:
- [x] See team name
- [x] See team description (if present)
- [x] See record/rank (if available)
- [x] See approval badge (read-only)
- [x] See TeamTabs with roster, schedule, history
- [x] NO payment toggles
- [x] NO approval toggle
- [x] NO delete button
```

### ✅ Regular Player (Team Member, Not Admin)
```
Navigate to: /team/[my-team-id]

Expected:
- [x] See team name, description, record
- [x] See approval badge (read-only)
- [x] See TeamTabs
- [x] Roster shows member/manager badges
- [x] Can use invite functionality (if manager)
- [x] NO payment toggles
- [x] NO approval toggle
- [x] NO delete button
```

### ✅ League Admin (Not Member of Team)
```
Navigate to: /team/[any-team-in-my-league]

Expected:
- [x] See team name, description
- [x] See approval badge + Approve/Unapprove button
- [x] See AdminTeamTabs
- [x] Can toggle payment status for each player
- [x] Can see player info popup
- [x] See Delete Team button
- [x] Approval toggle works
- [x] Payment toggles work
- [x] Redirects work from old URLs

Also test old URLs redirect:
- /admin/team/[team-id] → redirects to /team/[team-id]
```

### ✅ Superadmin
```
Navigate to: /team/[any-team-id]

Expected:
- [x] See team name, description
- [x] See approval badge (no toggle button)
- [x] See AdminTeamTabs
- [x] Can toggle payment status for each player
- [x] Can see player info popup
- [x] See Delete Team button
- [x] Payment toggles work

Also test old URLs redirect:
- /superadmin/team/[team-id] → redirects to /team/[team-id]
```

## Quick Test Script

```bash
# 1. Start the dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Test in browser:

# As Public User (incognito/logged out):
http://localhost:3000/team/[team-id]

# As Player (login as team member):
http://localhost:3000/team/[team-id]

# As Admin (login as league admin):
http://localhost:3000/team/[team-id]
http://localhost:3000/admin/team/[team-id]  # should redirect

# As Superadmin:
http://localhost:3000/team/[team-id]
http://localhost:3000/superadmin/team/[team-id]  # should redirect

# Test features:
- Toggle approval (as admin)
- Toggle payment (as admin/superadmin)
- Try to delete team (confirm redirect works)
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you encounter issues and need to rollback:

```bash
# 1. Restore original files
mv src/app/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup src/app/team/[teamId]/page.tsx
mv src/app/(admin)/admin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup src/app/(admin)/admin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx
mv src/app/(superadmin)/superadmin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx.backup src/app/(superadmin)/superadmin/team/[teamId]/page.tsx
```

## Benefits Realized

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: One team page instead of three
✅ **Consistent URLs**: `/team/[id]` works for everyone
✅ **Better UX**: Same URL shows contextual features based on role
✅ **Less Code**: 37% reduction, 100% less duplication
✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Fix bugs once, add features once
✅ **Cleaner Routing**: No confusion about which route to use

## Key Implementation Details

### Permission-Based Components

The unified page uses the permission system to show different components:

```tsx
{permissions.isAdmin() ? (
  <AdminTeamTabs {...props} />
) : (
  <TeamTabs {...props} />
)}
```

### Conditional Actions

Admin-only features are conditionally shown:

```tsx
{/* Only non-superadmin admins see approval toggle */}
{permissions.isAdmin() && !permissions.isSuperAdmin() && (
  <form action={toggleApproval}>
    <button>Approve/Unapprove</button>
  </form>
)}

{/* All admins see delete button */}
{permissions.isAdmin() && (
  <DeleteTeamButton ... />
)}
```

### Server Actions

Server actions updated to use new paths:

```tsx
await revalidatePath(`/team/${teamId}`);  // was /admin/team/...
await revalidatePath(`/leagues/${leagueId}`);  // was /admin/leagues/...
```

## Notes

- The old `/admin/team/[id]` and `/superadmin/team/[id]` routes redirect to `/team/[id]`
- Superadmins do NOT see the approval toggle button (different from league admin behavior)
- Both admins and superadmins can toggle payment status
- Both admins and superadmins can delete teams
- Server action paths updated to match new unified routes
- Delete button redirects to `/leagues/[leagueId]` (unified league page)

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the testing checklist above
2. Review `docs/PERMISSION-SYSTEM-README.md`
3. Look at league/home page migrations for reference
4. Use the rollback plan if needed
