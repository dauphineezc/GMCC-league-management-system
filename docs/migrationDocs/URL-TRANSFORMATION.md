## URL Comparison

### Before (Messy & Confusing)

**Superadmin navigating the site:**
```
http://yoursite.com/superadmin                     → Home
http://yoursite.com/superadmin/leagues             → League list
http://yoursite.com/superadmin/leagues/5v5         → League detail
http://yoursite.com/superadmin/teams               → Team list
http://yoursite.com/superadmin/team/abc123         → Team detail
http://yoursite.com/superadmin/players             → Player list
http://yoursite.com/superadmin/admins              → Admin list
http://yoursite.com/superadmin/export/admins.csv   → CSV export
```

**Admin navigating the site:**
```
http://yoursite.com/admin                          → Home
http://yoursite.com/admin/leagues/5v5              → League detail
http://yoursite.com/admin/team/abc123              → Team detail
```

**Player navigating the site:**
```
http://yoursite.com/player                         → Home
http://yoursite.com/leagues/5v5                    → League detail (then redirected!)
http://yoursite.com/team/abc123                    → Team detail
```

**Public user:**
```
http://yoursite.com/                               → Home (then redirected!)
http://yoursite.com/leagues/5v5                    → League detail (then redirected!)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Exposed implementation details (`/superadmin/`, `/admin/`)
- ❌ Different URLs for same content
- ❌ Confusing redirects
- ❌ Hard to share links
- ❌ Unprofessional appearance

---

### After (Clean & Professional)

**Everyone now uses the same clean URLs:**

```
http://yoursite.com/                    → Home (adapts to role)
http://yoursite.com/leagues             → League list (superadmin only)
http://yoursite.com/leagues/5v5         → League detail (adapts to role)
http://yoursite.com/teams               → Teams (adapts to role)
http://yoursite.com/team/abc123         → Team detail (adapts to role)
http://yoursite.com/players             → Player list (superadmin only)
http://yoursite.com/admins              → Admin list (superadmin only)
http://yoursite.com/export/admins.csv   → CSV export (superadmin only)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No implementation details exposed
- ✅ Same URLs for everyone
- ✅ No confusing redirects
- ✅ Easy to share links
- ✅ Professional appearance

## Superadmin Experience

### Before
```
Navbar links:
- Home → /superadmin
- Teams → /superadmin/teams
- Leagues → /superadmin/leagues
- Players → /superadmin/players
- Admins → /superadmin/admins

URLs in browser:
/superadmin/leagues/5v5
/superadmin/team/abc123
```
Unnecessarily long, exposes implementation ❌

### After
```
Navbar links:
- Home → /
- Teams → /teams
- Leagues → /leagues
- Players → /players
- Admins → /admins

URLs in browser:
/leagues/5v5
/team/abc123
```
Clean and professional! ✅

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Sharing a Team Link

**Before:**
```
Superadmin to another superadmin:
"Check out this team: yoursite.com/superadmin/team/warriors"

Admin to another admin:
"Check out this team: yoursite.com/admin/team/warriors"

Problem: Different URLs, confusing! ❌
```

**After:**
```
Anyone to anyone:
"Check out this team: yoursite.com/team/warriors"

Result: Works for everyone, shows appropriate view ✅
```

### Example 2: Bookmarking

**Before:**
```
Superadmin bookmarks: /superadmin/leagues
If they lose superadmin role, bookmark breaks ❌
```

**After:**
```
Superadmin bookmarks: /leagues
If they lose superadmin role, they get 404 (expected)
Clean URL in bookmarks ✅
```

### Example 3: Email/Slack Communications

**Before:**
```
"Please review this league: 
 http://yoursite.com/superadmin/leagues/fall-2025"
 
Looks unprofessional ❌
```

**After:**
```
"Please review this league:
 http://yoursite.com/leagues/fall-2025"
 
Looks professional ✅
```

## Technical Implementation

### Permission Checks Maintained

Every moved page has proper checks:

```tsx
// /players, /admins, /leagues (list), /teams (superadmin view)
export default async function Page() {
  const user = await getServerUser();
  if (!user) redirect("/login");
  if (!user.superadmin) notFound(); // 404 for non-superadmins
  // ... page content
}
```

### Unified Pages Adapt

```tsx
// /, /leagues/[id], /team/[id]
const permissions = await PermissionChecker.create(user, resourceId);

{/* Everyone sees base content */}
<BaseContent />

{/* Only admins see this */}
<IfAdmin checker={permissions}>
  <AdminControls />
</IfAdmin>

{/* Only superadmins see this */}
<IfSuperAdmin checker={permissions}>
  <SuperAdminControls />
</IfSuperAdmin>
```

### Team Routes
