# Schedule & Results Pages - Already Unified ✅

## Overview

Good news! The schedule and results pages were **already unified** and just needed cleanup and consistency updates.

## What Was Done

### 🧹 Cleanup
1. **Deleted** commented-out admin duplicate pages:
   - `src/app/(admin)/admin/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule/page.tsx` (was commented out)
   - `src/app/(admin)/admin/leagues/[leagueId]/results/page.tsx` (was commented out)

2. **Updated** existing pages to use new permission system:
   - `src/app/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/leagues/[leagueId]/results/page.tsx`

### ✅ Improvements Made

**Before**:
```tsx
const isAuthorized = await isLeagueAdminAsync(user, params.leagueId);
if (!isAuthorized) {
  redirect("/?error=unauthorized&message=...");
}
```

**After**:
```tsx
const isAuthorized = await hasLeaguePermission(user, params.leagueId, "admin");
if (!isAuthorized) {
  notFound(); // Cleaner error handling
}
```

## Current State

### Schedule Page
**Location**: `/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule`  
**Access**: Admin-only (both league admins and superadmins)  
**Purpose**: Upload and manage league schedules

**Features**:
- Upload schedule PDF
- Parse schedule from PDF
- Manual schedule entry
- View/edit schedule

### Results Page
**Location**: `/leagues/[leagueId]/results`  
**Access**: Admin-only (both league admins and superadmins)  
**Purpose**: Record and manage game results

**Features**:
- Record game scores
- Update game status
- View game history
- Calculate standings

## Why These Were Already Unified

Unlike home, league, and team pages, the schedule and results pages were:

1. **Always admin-only** - No public view needed
2. **Never had public duplicates** - Only admin pages existed
3. **Already at unified routes** - `/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule` and `/leagues/[leagueId]/results`
4. **Already had permission checks** - Used `isLeagueAdminAsync()`

The admin route versions were commented out (not in use), so there was nothing to migrate - just cleanup!

## Changes Summary

| File | Status | Action Taken |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule/page.tsx` | ✅ Updated | Now uses `hasLeaguePermission()` |
| `/leagues/[leagueId]/results/page.tsx` | ✅ Updated | Now uses `hasLeaguePermission()` |
| `/admin/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule/page.tsx` | 🗑️ Deleted | Was commented out, not in use |
| `/admin/leagues/[leagueId]/results/page.tsx` | 🗑️ Deleted | Was commented out, not in use |

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent permission system** - Now uses same `hasLeaguePermission()` as other pages  
✅ **Cleaner error handling** - Returns 404 instead of redirect with error message  
✅ **Less code** - Removed unused commented-out files  
✅ **Better organized** - All league management at `/leagues/[id]/*`

## Testing

These pages are admin-only, so test as:

### ✅ League Admin
```
Navigate to: /leagues/[your-league-id]/schedule

Expected:
- [x] Can access schedule management
- [x] Can upload/edit schedule
- [x] Can view schedule
```

```
Navigate to: /leagues/[your-league-id]/results

Expected:
- [x] Can access results management
- [x] Can record game results
- [x] Can update game status
```

### ✅ Superadmin
```
Same as league admin above - both roles have full access
```

### ✅ Public User / Regular Player
```
Navigate to: /leagues/[any-league-id]/schedule
Navigate to: /leagues/[any-league-id]/results

Expected:
- [x] Redirected to /login if not logged in
- [x] See 404 if logged in but not admin
```

## Routes Summary

All league-related routes now under `/leagues/[leagueId]/`:

```
/leagues/[leagueId]/              - League overview (unified, public/admin)
/leagues/[leagueId]/schedule      - Schedule management (admin-only) ✅
/leagues/[leagueId]/results       - Results management (admin-only) ✅
/leagues/[leagueId]/export.csv    - CSV export (admin-only)
```

Clean and consistent! 🎉

## No Migration Needed

Since these pages were already unified, there's:
- ❌ No need to update navigation links (already correct)
- ❌ No need to create redirect pages (no duplicates existed)
- ❌ No need to test multiple versions (only one version exists)

Just needed:
- ✅ Update to use new permission system
- ✅ Clean up commented-out files
- ✅ Document current state

---

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Already Unified, Now Consistent  
**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Next Step**: Continue using these pages as-is
