- should be a way for admin/super admin to export all players/all teams - simple to implement since we already have viewing capabilities for full roster of players/full roster of teams
- league or team should include practice schedule
- admins could also be players on a team of a different league
- divide league names up into gender (mens, womens, n/a) and division (low b, high b/a, etc)
- how do we want the league registration to work? right now, when creating a team, players can select any league. should we add registration start/end dates to the leagues to restrict when people can create a new team for that league?
